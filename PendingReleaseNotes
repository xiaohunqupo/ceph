>=18.0.0

* RGW's default backend for `rgw_enable_ops_log` changed from RADOS to file.
  The default value of `rgw_ops_log_rados` is now false, and `rgw_ops_log_file_path`
  defaults to "/var/log/ceph/ops-log-$cluster-$name.log".
* The SPDK backend for BlueStore is now able to connect to an NVMeoF target.
  Please note that this is not an officially supported feature.
* RGW's pubsub interface now returns boolean fields using bool. Before this change,
  `/topics/<topic-name>` returns "stored_secret" and "persistent" using a string
  of "true" or "false" with quotes around them. After this change, these fields
  are returned without quotes so they can be decoded as boolean values in JSON.
  The same applies to the `is_truncated` field returned by `/subscriptions/<sub-name>`.
* RGW's response of `Action=GetTopicAttributes&TopicArn=<topic-arn>` REST API now
  returns `HasStoredSecret` and `Persistent` as boolean in the JSON string
  encoded in `Attributes/EndPoint`.
* All boolean fields previously rendered as string by `rgw-admin` command when
  the JSON format is used are now rendered as boolean. If your scripts/tools
  relies on this behavior, please update them accordingly. The impacted field names
  are:
  * absolute
  * add
  * admin
  * appendable
  * bucket_key_enabled
  * delete_marker
  * exists
  * has_bucket_info
  * high_precision_time
  * index
  * is_master
  * is_prefix
  * is_truncated
  * linked
  * log_meta
  * log_op
  * pending_removal
  * read_only
  * retain_head_object
  * rule_exist
  * start_with_full_sync
  * sync_from_all
  * syncstopped
  * system
  * truncated
  * user_stats_sync
